## Inspiration
We built Trivia Time! with the goal of making learning fun. We want to encourage middle school students to be lifelong learners because the ability and desire to learn is a key tool for success in any field and any stage of life. With Trivia Time! educators and parents now have an additional resource to enhance student engagement and development. **Trivia Time! because playing is learning!** 

## What it does
Trivia Time is a quiz-based application. Players choose from educational categories like math, science, books, art, and history. They then answer questions to accumulate points. The more points players earn the more likely they are to get a badge.

## How we built it
We used the tkinter module in Python to develop the graphical user interface. Python was also used to develop the backend functionalities of the "Quiz Brain". Python modules pillow and playsound were also imported to edit images and utilize sound. The Open Trivia DB was the API used to get trivia questions for this demo. Freepix and Zapslat were used to download images (freepix) and mp3 files (zapslat).

## Challenges we ran into
We're **new players** in computer science. So, we have limited experience with different tech stacks and programming languages (beside python). We also *have*/*had* never built a complete application using a graphical user interface.   

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We developed a working minimum viable product. Players can select the books category, answer questions, and see their results.

## What we learned
We learned a great deal about the tkinter module in python and building a basic GUI. We also learned a great deal about splitting up a project into manageable tasks and working together to produce the final result using merge requests and other GitHub functionalities.
